# 3d_reconstruction

This is a graduation project.

The goal of this project is reconstruct a 3d point cloud from RGBD data captured by Intel RealSense D455i camera.

Based on some papers, this project tries to use ICP algorithm to register the point cloud.
And use Scan Context algorithm to improve the registration accuracy.
